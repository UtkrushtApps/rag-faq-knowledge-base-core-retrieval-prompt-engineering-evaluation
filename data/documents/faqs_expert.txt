**Q1: How do I update my billing address?**

**Q2: I was double-charged. How do I get a refund?**
A: If you notice duplicate charges, contact support via the "Report a Problem" page. Include your order number and payment receipt. Refunds typically resolve within 3-5 business days. Certain payment gateways (see [Appendix B]) may require manual review.
